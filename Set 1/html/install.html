<h1>Welcome to SearchManipulator's DIY Software.</h1>

<p>Please <b>click on the smaller fox icon</b> above the big fox in the top right of your screen.</p>
<br/>
<p>This screen will memorize your data and apply it to the necessary social media websites, while providing the technical aspects of SEO (search engine optimization) to ensure they rank highly on search results.</p>

<p><b>1) Start with Set 1</b> by selecting it in the drop down box in the main menu.</p>

<p><b>2) Type your information</b> into every data field in the main menu. Use the name you are targeting. If the negative website shows up for “Jon”, then do not use “Jonathan”. Leave your middle name blank if you are not targeting it.</p>

<p>Click on the <img src="../images/ques.png" style='width: 17px; height: 19px;'></img> icon for more of a description on each field.</p>

<p><b>3) Have at least four biographies</b> added in the main menu for EACH set you run. However, more biographies you provide the better. They should talk about you in the 3rd person and be 250-300 words each. The biographies need to be brand new to the internet; do not copy and paste your company profile, for example. A typical biography will read like your resume but in paragraph form. They will all saying similar things, but with different word choices and phrasing. Or if you prefer, you can have some or all biographies focus on a different facet of your life, like a hobby.</p>

<p>Professionally written biographies can be purchased from <a href="https://searchmanipulator.com/bios" target="_blank">SearchManipulator.com/Bios</a>, or you can provide your own.</p>

<p><b>4) When adding URLs</b> to the "Link 1-10" option at the bottom, select URLs that are directly below the negative website on search results, and websites you are proud of that you want to rank higher.</p>

<p>For example, if you have a LinkedIn page directly below the negative website on Google search results, you will want to add it, so the software can promote it to out-rank the negative website. But, if your LinkedIn out-ranks all negative websites, then there is no reason to promote it, so do not add it.</p>

<p><b>5) Click "SAVE"</b> at the top of the menu. This will save your information to your “downloads” folder in case you remove the app, so you don't have to re-type it.</p>

<p><b>6) Click "GO"</b> at the top of the menu. Work from left to right on the tabs. Look for instructions whenever you see the fox logo.</p>

<p><b>7) GoDaddy</b> is an easy and cheap way to buy a domain name after this; www.YourName.com, for example. The software will help get you started through our affiliate program, which will apply a big coupon to save you money and let us provide assistance.</p>

<p><b>8) If you are a small business,</b> then make the first word of the business be the "First Name" in the main menu of the software, and the remaining words of the business will be "Last Name".</p>

<p><b>9) Adding some pictures</b> of you throughout the process does help, but is not required.</p>

<p><b>10) Wait at least 2 weeks</b> before starting Set 2. Wait at least two weeks before doing Set 3 and Set 4 too. You want to wait at least 2 weeks in between sets because if you create too many sites too quickly, Google can catch on. It typically takes about a month for Google to process new websites into search results. </p>

<p><b>11) Updating the content</b> on high-ranking sites once every few months does help, but is not required. Replacing the old bios with brand new ones on high-ranking sites helps them rank higher. Sites on pages 4+ of Google search results can be ignored.</p>

<p> Constantly updating social media sites may cause a glitch, if so, just fill out the site as best as possible, and let us know. Please email us, <span style='color:blue;'>sales@searchmanipulator.com</span>, with any questions or concerns.</p>
